# ✅ FIXED - Project Should Now Work!

## What Was Fixed:

1. ✅ Renamed `LanguageContext.js` → `LanguageContext.jsx` (needed for JSX syntax)
2. ✅ Removed `'use client'` from LanguageContext.jsx
3. ✅ Fixed `postcss.config.js` to use ES modules
4. ✅ Fixed `tailwind.config.js` to use ES modules

## 🚀 How to Run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## 📍 Important:

The server is now running on: **http://localhost:5174/** (or 5173 if available)

**Just open that URL in your browser!**

## ✅ The Project Should Now Work!

All errors have been fixed. The React app should load correctly now.
