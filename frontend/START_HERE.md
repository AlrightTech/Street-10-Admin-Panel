# 🚀 START HERE - How to Run the Project

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is a FRONTEND-ONLY Project

**You don't need the backend anymore!** All backend code has been removed. This is now a pure React.js application.

---

## ✅ CORRECT WAY TO RUN:

### Step 1: Go to FRONTEND folder
```bash
cd frontend
```

### Step 2: Start the server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Look at the terminal output
You'll see something like:
```
VITE v5.x.x  ready in XXX ms

➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

### Step 4: Open that URL in your browser
Copy the URL from terminal (e.g., `http://localhost:5173/`) and paste it in your browser!

---

## ❌ DON'T DO THIS:
- ❌ Don't go to `backend` folder
- ❌ Don't run `npm run dev` in backend
- ❌ Backend has been removed - it's not needed!

---

## 📍 Current Location Check:

**If you're in:** `Street-10-Admin-Panel\backend` ❌ WRONG
**You need to be in:** `Street-10-Admin-Panel\frontend` ✅ CORRECT

---

## 🎯 Quick Commands:

```bash
# From project root:
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

That's it! The app will run on http://localhost:5173 (or similar port)

---

## 💡 Remember:
- **Frontend folder** = Where you run the project ✅
- **Backend folder** = Not needed anymore ❌
- Keep the terminal open while the server is running!
