# 🚀 QUICK START - Run Your Project

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open Terminal/PowerShell
Navigate to the frontend folder:
```bash
cd frontend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies (First Time Only)
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Open Your Browser
The server will start and show you a URL like:
- **Local:** http://localhost:5173
- Or another port if 5173 is busy

**Just copy and paste that URL into your browser!**

---

## ✅ What You Should See

1. Terminal shows: `VITE v5.x.x ready in XXX ms`
2. A URL like: `Local: http://localhost:5173/`
3. Open that URL in your browser
4. You'll see the **Role Selection Page** first

---

## 🔧 If It's Still Not Working

### Check if server is running:
Look at your terminal - you should see:
```
VITE v5.x.x  ready in XXX ms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

### If you see errors:
1. Make sure you're in the `frontend` folder
2. Run `npm install` again
3. Try `npm run dev` again

### Port Already in Use?
If port 5173 is busy, Vite will automatically use the next available port (5174, 5175, etc.)
Just use the URL shown in your terminal!

## 📝 Important Notes

- **Keep the terminal open** - The dev server needs to keep running
- **Don't close the terminal** - Closing it stops the server
- **The URL in terminal is what you need** - Copy it exactly as shown

---

## 🎯 That's It!

Once you see the URL in your terminal, just open it in your browser and you're good to go! 🎉
